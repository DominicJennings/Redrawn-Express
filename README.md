# Redrawn
Redrawn was originaly created by anger towards the wrapper devs and it's community. good news is that Redrawn is coming back.
## Why bring back redrawn if you couldn't fix it?
thats because the project was not seen in a while and we desided to bring back the project. Redrawn express is a beta version of what the brand new redrawn is expected to look like. the new one currently is using goanimate wrappers code witch is no longer stable. using the beta version may help solve some issues you are having with goanimate wrapper and it has inproved movie parsing (Taken from Wrapper: Offline but some new features arent and created by joseph the animator himself)
